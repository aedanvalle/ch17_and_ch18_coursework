This is chattrbox without the gravatars working properly but it's something

IMPORTANT: running on localhost:3000 after typing npm start in folder!!!

I'm not sure what's wrong with the gravatars, but it's saying that they get loaded into the browser elements so i'm not entirely sure what's going on or how to remedy the situation. This is what i was able to complete up until this point.
